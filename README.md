# Playlist Authority

## Vision Statement

For video game enthusiasts and Star Wars fans alike, who need a game that combines the immersive worlds of Star Wars into a gaming experience, Star Wars Imperial Assault is a tabletop strategy game ported to video game platforms that puts the player in the roles of lesser know heroes of the Star Wars universe and pits them against Imperial and Mercenary factions in multiple different ways. Unlike other Star Wars games, our product, Imperial Assault is a highly strategic game, built in Unity in 2.5D and uses tabletop wargame rules, such as range, asymmetrical abilities, and dice-based combat. Our product offers the service on an online browser, accessible to anyone with an internet connection as well as a system install.
